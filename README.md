# FoodRunner-App
Android App for ordering food online built using Kotlin and XML

The app is built in Kotlin and uses Firebase Firestore for online data storage and retrieval. It also loads restaurant images and menu data from local assets while functioning as an online food delivery app.

### Main features of the app
1. Recycler Views
2. Fragments
3. Firebase Firestore Integration
4. Local Asset Loading
5. Adapters
6. Favorites Management
7. Cart Functionality
8. Order History

## How to use the app
1. Launch the app and log in with your credentials
2. Browse the list of restaurants
3. Select a restaurant to view its menu
4. Add items to your cart
5. Place your order
6. View your order history in the profile section

## How the app works
- The app loads restaurant data and images from local assets
- When you interact with the app (adding favorites, placing orders, etc.), the data is stored in Firebase
- This hybrid approach allows for fast loading of images while maintaining online functionality
